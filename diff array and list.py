"""
In Python, the main differences between arrays and lists lie in their functionality, performance, and use cases. Here's a detailed comparison:

Feature	List	Array
Definition	A built-in Python data structure for storing a collection of items.	Provided by the array module or third-party libraries like NumPy, designed for numerical computations.
Data Type	Can store elements of different types (e.g., integers, strings, floats).	Typically stores elements of the same type (e.g., all integers or all floats).
Usage	General-purpose; suitable for most tasks involving collections of data.	Best for mathematical or numerical operations requiring homogeneous data.
Performance	Slower for large numerical computations due to dynamic typing.	Faster for numerical operations due to type constraints and optimized memory handling.
Memory Efficiency	Less memory efficient since elements can have different types.	More memory efficient as all elements share the same type.
Module Requirement	No additional module required (native to Python).	Requires importing the array module or third-party libraries like NumPy.
Functionality	Supports a wide range of operations like insertion, deletion, and sorting.	Limited to numerical operations unless using NumPy for advanced functionality.
Example Code	my_list = [1, "hello", 3.5]	import array; my_array = array.array('i', [1, 2, 3])
Use Case	When flexibility in data type is needed or for general-purpose tasks.	When performance and memory efficiency are critical, especially in scientific computing.
When to Use What?
Use Lists:
When working with mixed data types or when the collection isn't primarily numerical (e.g., [1, "apple", 3.5]).

Use Arrays:
When working with large numerical datasets or requiring efficient operations (e.g., matrices, vectors). For advanced computations, NumPy arrays are highly recommended.
